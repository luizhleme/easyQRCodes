easyQRCodes
===========
This is a simple Java project that implements a QRCode library called ZXing. With this project is possible to read and write a QRCode in a simple way.

To use it:

- Remove the Exemplo.java of the project.
- Generate a jar file of the project. 
Until here everything right. Now:

- Assemble your project, put in it  the generated jar, and  more two jar files that be find in the lib folder of the project easyQRCodesExample project (my other repository).
Now you can use it.

In the easyQRCodesExample you can see how to use this implementation.

Enjoy to contribute with the next version, that will be done without these two jar.
